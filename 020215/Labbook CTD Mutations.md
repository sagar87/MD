## CTD Mutations

### Possible Mutations and Questions

* Control: 14 aa long CTD
* CTD pS2
    * Does the conformational ensemble change if S2 is phosphorylated?
* CTD pS5
    * Does the conformational ensemble change if S5 is phosphorylated?
    * Does S5p phosphorylation infer β turn formation ?
* Three hydrogen bonds stabilize the β turn (Meinhart & Cramer)
    * pS2b carbonyl - S5b amide (S2E lethal in yeast) 
    * pS2b γ oxigen - T4b amide
    * pS2b phophate - T4b hydroxyl
        * How important is the hydroxyl group of T4b for β turn formation → T4V
* P3 and P5 in cis configuration → would most probably infer β turn formation (Meinhart & Cramer)
    * Can hydrogen bonds be formed when Proline is cis configuration
* CTD Y1F have been shown to be lethal in yeast
    * Does Y1 contribute to β turn formation
